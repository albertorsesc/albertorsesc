# About me
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects, private and public to be. One of those is a Go to app for everything related to Construction industry which is released in my country (Mexico) and the other one is an application to find anything related to pets: adoptions, lost and found, vets and other resources which I'll release in July 2021.
- ðŸŒ± Besides Web development my second/first passion is Bug Bounty Hunting.
